            <p className="aboutSection">This project was made in collaboration by Harrison Wilson and Dovid Edelkopf for our phase 2 React project at the Flatiron school. For our project we had the idea to make a webpage where people could find other people
                to with which they could play tabletop games. On our home page, you can view other user's posts, leave a comment if you'd like, filter posts by relevance and even create your own! If you are looking for a game that we
                do not currently support, you can add it to our site by using our add a game button. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="aboutSection"> We worked really hard on this website and we hope that you enjoy using it! ðŸ˜Š</p>
